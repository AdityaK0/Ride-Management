## Custom Script for Record Creation
To automate the creation of required Doctype records, a custom script has been created. This script can be executed using the following command:
```bash
bench --site <site_name> execute ride_management.api.createRecords
```

### Example Script Logic
The script includes logic to:
- Create customers.
- Add items with predefined properties.
- Add demo vehicle rides.
- Add ride bookings with services.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/Ride-Management.git
   ```
2. Install the app on your site:
   ```bash
   bench --site <site_name> install-app ride_management
   ```
3. Migrate the database:
   ```bash
   bench --site <site_name> migrate
   ```
4. Execute the record creation script if needed.

## Notes
- Ensure the app is installed on a Frappe site before running scripts or creating records.
- Fixtures are exported to preserve default items, doctypes, and custom configurations.
